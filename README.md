===========

**transform angular power spectra and correlation functions**

This is a minimal Python package for transformations between angular power
spectra and correlation functions.  It is currently limited to the zero spin
case.

The package can be installed using pip:

    pip install transformcl

Then import the `cltoxi` and `xitocl` functions from the package:

    from transformcl import cltoxi, xitocl

For more information, please see the [documentation].

Current functionality covers the absolutely minimal use case.  Please open an
issue on GitHub if you would like to see anything added.
